# üì¶ YOLOv5 + VisDrone Integration on Tensorleap
This project demonstrates how to integrate a YOLOv5 model with the VisDrone dataset using the Tensorleap platform. The integration is handled via the leap_binder.py script, which defines how data is loaded, visualized, and evaluated.

This guide walks you through setup, local testing, model export, and pushing your project to Tensorleap.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
* 	Python >=3.8, <3.12 
* 	[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed 
*	The [Tensorleap CLI](https://docs.tensorleap.ai/tensorleap-integration/cli-assets-upload) installed and authenticated

## üì• Setup Instructions  
### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Tensorleap-hub/yolov5_visdrone.git
cd yolov5_visdrone
```
### Install Dependencies
This project uses Poetry for environment management.
```
poetry install
```
To run Python scripts using the virtual environment:
```
poetry run python leap_custom_test.py
```
### üìÇ Dataset Configuration
This integration uses the [VisDrone dataset](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset). Dataset structure should follow this pattern:
```
VisDrone/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ val/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
```

Each label file must match the corresponding image name and contain YOLO-style bounding box annotations:
```
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>  # All normalized [0, 1]
```

#### Dataset Path
Point the path field in VisDrone.yaml to your dataset root (must be inside the tensorleap mounted folder - usually ~/tensorleap).

To use a custom .yaml file, update the data_path inside the preprocess_func_leap() function in leap_binder.py.



## ‚úÖ Local Validation (Highly Recommended)
Before pushing to Tensorleap, run a local test to verify that data loading and visualization work correctly:
```
poetry run python leap_custom_test.py
```
This checks:
* 	Data integration logic
*	Bounding box visualization
*	Metric and metadata computation

## üß† Exporting Your Own Model
If you wish to evaluate a custom PyTorch model, use the provided export function:
```
from leap_utils import export_onnx
export_onnx(model, "your_model.onnx")
```
This ensures compatibility with Tensorleap‚Äôs ONNX pipeline.

---

## üöÄ Pushing to Tensorleap
Once local validation passes:
```
leap project push weights/yolov5s-visdrone.onnx
```
Follow CLI prompts to select (or create) the:
* Model
* Project
* Code Integration

**Note**: If the model mapping (shown under the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù tab) has changed compared to Visdrone, reach out or adjust accordingly. This only needs to be done once.

After confirming the mapping, click ‚ÄúValidate Assets‚Äù on the platform to verify shapes and consistency.

## üìå Code Integration Overview (leap_binder.py) 
This script defines how your model and dataset interact with the Tensorleap platform.

#### Preprocessing
* 	```preprocess_func_leap()``` - 
Loads and structures train, val, and test datasets using your YAML config.

#### Encoding
* 	```input_encoder()``` - 
Converts images to normalized NumPy arrays in channel-last format (HWC).
* 	```gt_encoder()``` -
Processes ground truth bounding boxes.

#### Metadata
* 	```sample_metadata()``` -
Computes per-sample stats like sharpness, object count, and bounding box sizes.

#### Custom Loss
* 	```yolov5_loss()``` -
YOLOv5-style multi-scale loss function using raw model outputs.

#### Visualizers
* 	```image_visualizer()``` -
Shows raw input image.
* 	```bb_decoder()``` -
Displays ground truth bounding boxes.
* 	```bb_predictor()``` -
Applies NMS and shows predicted boxes.

#### Metrics
* 	```get_per_sample_metrics()``` -
Computes precision, recall, F1, IoU, and accuracy per sample.

#### Predictions

Registered via ```leap_binder.add_prediction()```:
*  Final detection outputs (processed and ready for NMS, used in eval mode) 
* Intermediate feature maps (e.g., concatenate_128, 64, 32, used for loss computation)

## üõ† Tips & Troubleshooting
#### Common errors:
##### ```leap_custom_test.py``` failures:
* Shape mismatch - debug and verify tensors shapes
* Bounding boxes are misaligned in visualizations - make sure you follow the correct bbox convention.
#### Validate Assets failures:
* ```leap_custom_test.py``` passes and Validate Assets fails - check the mapping in the Network tab. 
#### Usage tips:
* If your code integration is working and you only need to update the code (without changing the model), use ```leap code push``` instead of ```leap project push``` to avoid re-uploading an already functioning model.
* If not sure what code integration is currently in Tensorleap's platform - go to code integration tab in the network tab and see the last update time (and the code itself)
